# The Seattle Spirits Society Blended Malt Whisky Recipe

This purpose of this repo is to store the current and best Seattle Spirits Society Blended Malt Whisky Recipe, which was originally created during our 49th Tasting Meeting in July 2016. We're moving this recipe to GitHub so we can improve upon it through collaboration with Whisky-loving developers and technologists all over the world!

During the tasting, we split our members into two teams and had them create an original blend in only 20 minutes. [TAG 49](http://seattlespiritssociety.com/tasting-notes/tag-49-exclusive-blended-malt-whisky) edged out [King Tide](http://seattlespiritssociety.com/tasting-notes/king-tide-exclusive-blended-malt-whisky) and won the competition.

We'll evaluate pull requests to this recipe by having our members taste and rate them in comparison. Blended malt whisky recipes that rate better will replace our current recipe through us merging the pull request!

## Current Recipe

* 4 parts Aberlour 12

## How to Contribute

1. Devise a recipe that changes the recipe in one way. You can swap out one above spirit, add an additional spirit, or change the parts measurement on one existing spirit.
  * A spirit added must be a single malt whisky, though it doesn't have to actually be Scotch.
  * A spirit added must be generally available at better whisky/whiskey stores and be under $100 USD.
4. Submit a pull request of this README file with your change in place above.
5. We'll comment on it and review, and if we think it has a chance, we'll schedule a tasting for our members to try it out.
